# Data Analysis Documentation

## Overview
This folder contains the code and files related to the data analysis phase of the project. In this phase, we analyze the extracted data to derive meaningful insights and conclusions.

## Folder Structure
- [**Documentation**](/Project-Operations/06.Data-Analysis/Analysis-Report.pdf): Contains documents explaining the analysis processes and results.
- [**Data.xlsx**](/Project-Operations/06.Data-Analysis/Data.xlsx): The dataset used for analysis.
- [**analysis.ipynb**](/Project-Operations/06.Data-Analysis/analysis-part1.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook containing the initial data analysis code and exploratory data analysis.
- [**analysis2.ipynb**](/Project-Operations/06.Data-Analysis/analysis-part2.ipynb): An additional Jupyter Notebook for complementary data analysis.

## Libraries Used
The following Python libraries were used in this phase:
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn`: For data visualization and plotting graphs.
- `scikit-learn`: For machine learning models and statistical analysis (if applicable).
- `scipy`: For scientific computing and statistical analysis.
- `seaborn`: For advanced data visualization and enhanced statistical plots.

## Key Questions Analyzed
The analysis aimed to answer the following key questions:

## Usage
To review the analysis, open the `.ipynb` files using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment that supports interactive Python code execution.

Ensure that all dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` are installed before running the notebooks. You can set up your environment and install dependencies using the following steps:

### Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/0PeterAdel/Data-Dyanamos.git
cd Data-Dyanamos
```

### Create a Virtual Environment
#### On Windows (using `venv`)
```sh
python -m venv env
env\Scripts\activate
```

#### On Linux/macOS (using `venv`)
```sh
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

### Install Dependencies and Navigate to the Analysis Folder
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd Project-Operations/06.Data-Analysis
```
